### Introduction

cursor/selection range highlight extension.

* cursor only: no selection range, only cursor on line.
* single line: when selection range is not multiline.
* multi line: when you select multiple lines in single range.
* mutl cursor: when selection is more than 1, meaning when you use multi cursor editing.

### Disclaimer

it is usable if not tweak config too much.
feel free to tweak with `opacity` and `background opacity` and each `border color` and `background color` for different selection types.

all the functions are working with selection change but config code is not fully complete.
readme is not complete. :(
