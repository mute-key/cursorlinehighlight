Please let me explain why the restrictions are in the license as is.

I personally do not believe that this code has any commercial opportunities, 
or that I do not want it for now. it is still incomplete in its current state 
and i don't think anyone would or should pay to use this extension. I start 
this to learn and to make features that I think will be useful. It is a rather 
simple overlay tool and I hope this extenion as an upgrade of QOL of vscode.
