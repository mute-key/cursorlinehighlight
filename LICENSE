Please let me explain why the restrictions are in the license as is.

I personally do not believe that this code has any commercial opportunities, 
that it can create any commercial interest at all, or that I want it to now.
As it is still incomplete in its current state, I don't think anyone would 
or should pay to use this extension. I did not start this to make money. 
It has features that I wanted for a long time, features that work for me. 
And I hope it finds some use if anyone finds this type of extension useful 
and an upgrade of QOL using VS Code.
