I personally do not believe that this code has any commercial opportunities, 
, or that I want it to for as of now. It can change later but i hope it stay 
as is currently. it is still incomplete in its current state, I don't think 
anyone would or should pay to use this extension. I did not start this to 
make money but to learn, first off... It has features that I wanted, features 
that work for me. I would guess that it is not very useful, it is a rather 
simple overlay, but I hope the extension is useful and an upgrade of QOL 
using VS Code.
