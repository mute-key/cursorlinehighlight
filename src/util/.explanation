a lot of code is very unlike typical ts codebase, due to my personal preferrence of 
use of references over pure functions. 

i very much like the elegancy of references in js, and how you can maximize the 
memory intergrity. 

pure functions are good as is, and i understand why it is useful, however it is a 
stupid function in my perspectives. in extenions like this, considering the 
relatively small size of codebase, it could be well be a performance bottleneck 
and overcomplicate the context and data intergrity. 

if you happens to be interested in the codebase and want to understand why it is 
how it is, it is because the heavy use of references with closure. 

there are still a lot to annotate and refactor, but i rather take time to polish 
them as the time allows me since this is a work of passion of mine.
